# Calendar
## Quick Intro
- A small project as a midterm project when I first took the C programming course in 2020 .
- This small project has been stored in my local device until now (2022), today I suddenly find out so I push it onto my Github.

## Quick Start
- In the terminal, redirect to the path of the program:
    - To compile:<br>
    ```bash
    make calendar
    ```

    - To run:<br>
    ```bash
    ./calendar display_calendar_option(year/month)
    ```
- When it shows the below command, input a year that you want to show <br>
    ```bash
    Calendar -
    ```
- If you choose the <code>month</code> option, you may need to input the month number in the <code>Month (Number)</code> as well
